# Loan Default Prediction Model
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default using machine learning models. The dataset includes financial and demographic features such as income, credit amount, employment status, and family size. Three classification models were trained and evaluated:

+ Logistic Regression (Baseline)

+ Random Forest Classifier

+ XGBoost Classifier

The best-performing model can be used by financial institutions to assess credit risk and reduce defaults.

## ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values (imputation/removal)

Feature engineering

Categorical encoding (One-Hot Encoding)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings:

XGBoost outperformed others due to handling imbalanced data better.
